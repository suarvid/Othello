-- for determining which pieces to flip in a given board
-- could probably start by only taking the last move made into account

-- one strategy is to get all white indexes in a row
-- and all black indexes and then compare to see if

-- if the maximum of either colour is greater than the minimum of the other,
-- and the minimum of that colour is less than the maximum
